# The Uneven Climb of Low-Carbon Energy

## Project Overview
The global rise of low-carbon energy - including hydropower, nuclear, solar, wind, and other renewables - was analyzed from 1965 to 2024. Regional trends, growth rates, and disparities across continents were examined, highlighting policy and investment gaps that affect the clean energy transition.

## Data Source

Data on the share of primary energy consumption from low-carbon sources was used:

- **Our World in Data – Low-Carbon Share of Energy**  
  https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-energy-low-carbon  
  *(Processed data used for analysis and visualization)*

- **Energy Institute – Statistical Review of World Energy (2025)**  
  Original source of global energy consumption statistics.

The dataset measures low-carbon energy as a percentage of primary energy, combining nuclear and renewable sources.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python  
  - pandas – used for data cleaning and analysis  
  - matplotlib,plotly – used for visualization  
- Jupyter Notebook – used for analysis and reporting  
- Git & GitHub – used for version control

## Methodology / What Was Done

- Global low-carbon energy data was collected and cleaned  
- Regional shares and growth trends were calculated from 1965–2024  
- Adoption across continents was compared, and plateaus and accelerations were identified  
- Visualizations were created to communicate uneven progress and disparities  
- Insights into policy and investment factors affecting the transition were generated

---

## Key Findings

- Global low-carbon share increased from 6% (1965) to 19% (2024)  
- South America leads (~40%), Europe steadily above 25%, North America recently passed 20%  
- Asia remains near 15%, Africa below 10% due to underinvestment  
- Global plateau in the 1990s–2000s reflected policy hesitation, not technological limits  
- Transition acceleration requires stable policies, equitable financing, and faster fossil fuel phase-outs
